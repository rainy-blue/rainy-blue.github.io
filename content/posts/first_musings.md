### crossing the starting line!
For the longest time, the idea of starting this blog danced in the recesses of my mind, but I had never mustered the energy to get over the initial hump. 

Growing up, I was insatiably curious. Not just about the tangible and immediate around me, but about the vast expanse of the cosmos and the mysteries that lay within. Every new discovery led me into a maze of questions, diving deep into how things worked and letting my imagination roam free. 

On family trips to places like Yellowstone National Park, I wouldn’t just see geysers and majestic landscapes. In my mind’s eye I was an early explorer, envisioning how I would chart out the vast terrains, marking every striking landmark and documenting every unique discovery. Nights at home were a whole different adventure. I’d lay back, head in the stars, plotting my interstellar journeys. I’d contemplate which planets and moons I would visit, crafting complex plans for my cosmic travels. 

I’d often catch random inspiration from a snippet of song lyrics I heard on the radio or read a profound quote from a book. Hoping to preserve their wisdom, I would try to tether all these moments to my memory, yet they would occasionally slip away before I could fully grasp them. I have a decent memory, but I am no Mike Ross. I do not think this was necessarily due to a lack of effort, but simply because the universe overflowed with wonders beyond my young mind’s capacity to comprehend and chronicle. 

So, like footprints in the sand, I have left traces of these thoughts and ideas everywhere. Scattered across legal pads, sticky-notes, and entries in my Notes app, you’ll find my chicken scratch notes — my attempts to capture these random thoughts, to-dos, to-reads, to-learns…

Why did I decide to finally cross the starting line? I'm not sure. Perhaps for self-expression. Perhaps because writing can be cathartic. Perhaps I was bored. Perhaps, I just felt like it. 

>This blog is probably going to be more reminiscent of my stream of consciousness - expect spontaneity, raw thoughts, and the 
occasional ramble. I will likely write about a myriad of topics. And someday, I will get around to organizing them (or at least tagging them). Some of this might be incoherent babbling, but maybe once in a blue moon, you’ll discover a gem amidst the chaos.
